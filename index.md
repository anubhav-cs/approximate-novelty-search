## What is LAPKT?

### LAPKT stands for Lightweight Automated Planning Toolkit

It aims to make your life easier if your purpose is to create, use or extend basic to advanced Automated Planners. It's an open-source Toolkit written in C++ and Python with simple interfaces that give you complete flexibility by decoupling parsers from problem representations and algorithms. It has been succesfully used in embedded systems, webservices, compilations, replanning and contains some of the high-performance planners from the last International Planning Competition 2014.
